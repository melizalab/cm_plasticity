This project looks at how experience affects intrinsic membrane properties in CM. Some of the analyses, particularly the methods used to calculate phasicness, are derived from Chen and Meliza 2018 (cm_physiology) and Chen and Meliza 2020 (cm_devel), but there has been a substantial reorganization and simplification of the analysis pipeline.

The purpose of this file is to identify directories, file, and scripts, as well as instructions on the analysis workflow.
